PREFACE
**************************************************

Preface #1: All the working directories for the code scripts are set using there here::here() function. This means that working directories do not need to be edited, so long as the file structure is maintained.

Preface #2: If replication is not necessary please refer to the knitted versions in "07. Knitted Files"
  [Step 1] Dataset-creation.rmd
  [Step 2] Regression Analysis.rmd
  [Step 3] Visualization.rmd


FILE STRUCTURE
**************************************************
01. Archived Code : Archived codes, not necessary for replication
02. Inputs : Folder with downloaded datasets to create our dataset
03. Intermediaries : Folder with datasets that are in the middle of being processed. Will be used as inputs for creating the final dataset. 
04. Outputs : Folder with finalized datasets.
05. Visualizations : Folder with finalized visualizations.
06. Literature : Folder storing literature that was being referred to.
07. Knitted Files : Folder for storing knitted versions of R script.


REPLICATION STEPS
**************************************************
1. Create the dataset using "PP5531_Rproj_US-elections_dataset-creation.Rmd"
2. Conduct the regression analysis using "PP5531_Rproj_US-elections_reg-analysis.Rmd"
3. Create visualizations using "PP5531_Rproj_US-elections_visualization.Rmd"
